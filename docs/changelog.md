# Changelog

## 2026-11-07: slice 1 foundation and design round 2

- Thread store (5b475b9): node:sqlite WAL, migrations through
  `user_version`, a turn buffer that keeps deltas in memory only. A child
  SIGKILLed mid-stream leaves exactly its completed messages on disk.
- Contracts and socket (7fddd5d, 8741597): Effect Schema method and push
  tables typing both ends, decoders with named error codes, a loopback
  socket gated on the per-launch token and an Origin list. A mirror test
  fails when a module's copy of a wire shape drifts from the contracts.
- Ollama runtime (4eb5af2): reuse a healthy Ollama on 11434, otherwise an
  app-owned one on 11435 from a pinned, hash-checked v0.40.15 install;
  only a PID whose start time and command still match is ever stopped.
  Real discovery here: Ollama 0.40.4 external, 14 models.
- Chat and fit (e54cafc): explicit `num_ctx` on every request, 16k floor,
  thinking kept apart, fit verdicts that name their numbers. Real run:
  qwen3.5:9b at 16384 beside whisper, whisper 2202 MiB before and after.
- Desktop (2290627): Electron main supervises the server, token in the
  environment, a crash view with Restart; headless Electron 45 smoke
  passed.
- Server (2ce6d1d): `createApp` wires every protocol method; `main.ts`
  meets the supervisor contract. 196 tests green on a fresh clone.
- Design (a59b654, 229d293): Ethan asked for black and gray with green,
  sleek, simple out of the box; two T3 Code-shaped HTML harnesses carry
  that palette, and a council hill climb (`docs/design/council-rubric.md`)
  scores them against nine professional apps.
- Design council rounds 1 and 2 (b881380, 8f509f3, 3d60c2c, 7a4e750):
  round 1 seated Opus, Sol and Muse plus a jester; B won two seats to one
  and became `docs/design/shell.html` with 26 fixes, a first-run screen and
  a Settings screen. Round 2 (Sol alone) scored it 8 against a best
  reference of 8.5: 0.5 behind, from 1.5 behind on the same seat's scale.
  F02b-F33 are open; runs are logged in `docs/evidence/2026-11.md`.

## 2026-11-07: scaffold

Promoted from the maintainer's private planning folder. pnpm workspace with
`apps/desktop`, `apps/server`, `apps/web`, `packages/contracts` and
`packages/harness`; `pnpm verify` runs tsc, oxlint and vitest, exits 0 clean
and 1 on a planted type error or lint error (both checked).
